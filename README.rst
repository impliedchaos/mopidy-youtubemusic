Configuration
=============

Before starting Mopidy, you must add configuration for
Mopidy-YTMusic to your Mopidy configuration file::

    [ytmusic]
    enabled = true

By default Mopidy-YTMusic will connect to YouTube Music as a guest account.  This
has limited options.  If you would like to connect to YouTube Music with your
account (free or premium) you'll need to generate an auth.json file and configure
Mopidy-YTMusic to use it.

To create an auth.json file run :code:`mopidy ytmusic setup` and follow instructions
in the terminal. When you're done it will tell you what config options you need
to add to your Mopidy configuration file.

Authenticated users have access to their listening history, likes,
playlists and uploaded music.  Premium users have access to high quality audio
streams and other premium content. 

Other configuration options are as follows:

- :code:`auto_playlist_refresh` - time (in minutes) to refresh the Auto playlists.  Default: 60. Set to 0 to disable auto playlists.
- :code:`youtube_player_refresh` - time (in minutes) to refresh the Youtube player url (used for decoding the signature).  Default: 15
- :code:`playlist_item_limit` - Number of items to grab from playlists.  This is not exact.  Default: 100
- :code:`subscribed_artist_limit` - Number of subscriptions to list. Default: 100. Set to 0 to disable subscription list.
- :code:`enable_history` - Show Recently Played playlist. Default: yes
- :code:`enable_liked_songs` - Show Liked Songs playlist. Default: yes
